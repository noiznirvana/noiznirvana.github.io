        <section id="tessera-image" class="prayer-section">
            <h2>Tessera</h2>
            <img src="tessera.JPG" alt="Vexillum Legionis Mariae - Standard of the Legion of Mary">
            <p class="border-text">
                Inimicitias ponam inter te et mulierem et semen tuum et semen illius ipsum conteret caput tuum. (Gen 3:15)<br>
                Ecce Mater tua &bull; Mulier ecce filius tuus. (Jn 19:26-27)<br>
                Magnificat anima mea Dominum. (Lk 1:46)<br>
                Beata quae credidit. (Lk 1:45)
            </p>

            <div class="explanation">
                <p>The Legion of Mary Tessera image is a powerful symbolic representation of the organization's devotional outlook and spiritual warfare. The border inscription on the Tessera contains several significant Latin phrases:</p>
                <p><strong>"Inimicitias ponam inter te et mulierem et semen tuum et semen illius; ipsum conteret caput tuum"</strong> - This translates to "I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will strike your head." (Genesis 3:15). This refers to God's promise of redemption and the eternal conflict between good and evil.</p>
                <p><strong>"Mulier, ecce filius tuus: . . . Ecce mater tua"</strong> - Meaning "Woman, here is your son . . . Here is your mother." (John 19:26-27). This represents Mary's spiritual motherhood of all believers.</p>
                <p><strong>"Beata quae credidit"</strong> - Translating to "Blessed is she who believed" (Luke 1:45). This emphasizes Mary's faith and her role in salvation history.</p>
                <p>The border also features a chain design, symbolizing the Catena (Latin for "chain"), representing the unity of all Legionaries in daily prayer. The inscription and imagery together convey the Legion's devotion to Mary, its spiritual warfare against evil, and the unity of its members in faith and prayer.</p>

            <h3>Let us pray</h3>
             <p>Confer, O Lord, on us, who serve beneath the standard of Mary, that fullness of faith in you and trust in her, to which it is given to conquer the world. Grant us a lively faith, animated by charity, which will enable us to perform all our actions from the motive of pure love of you, and ever to see you and serve you in our neighbour; a faith, firm and immovable as a rock, through which we shall rest tranquil and steadfast amid the crosses, toils and disappointments of life; a courageous faith which will inspire us to undertake and carry out without hesitation great things for your glory and for the salvation of souls; a faith which will be our Legion's Pillar of Fire - to lead us forth united<br>
             &mdash; to kindle everywhere the fires of divine love<br>
             &mdash; to enlighten those who are in darkness and in the shadow of death<br>
             &mdash; to inflame those who are lukewarm<br>
             &mdash; to bring back life to those who are dead in sin;<br>
             and which will guide our own feet in the way of peace; so that &mdash; the battle of life over &mdash; our Legion may reassemble, without the loss of any one, in the kingdom of your love and glory. Amen.</p>

             <p>May the souls of our departed legionaries and the souls of all the faithful departed through the mercy of God rest in peace. Amen.</p>

             <p>In the name of the Father, etc.</p>

            <h2>Prayer for the Beatification of the Servant of God</h2>
            <h3>Frank Duff</h3>

            <h4>God our Father,</h4>

            <p>You inspired your servant Frank Duff with a profound insight into the mystery of your Church, the Body of Christ, and of the place of Mary the Mother of Jesus in this mystery.<br>
            In his immense desire to share this insight with others and in filial dependance on Mary, he formed her Legion to be a sign of her maternal love for the world and a means of enlisting all her children in the Church's evangelising work.</p>
            <p>We thank you Father for the graces conferred on him and for the benefits accruing to the Church from his courageous and shining faith.<br>
            With confidence we beg you that through his intercession, you grant the petition we lay before you ..........<br>
            We ask too that if it be in accordance with your will, the holiness of his life may be acknowledged by the Church for the glory of your Name.</p>

            <p class="conclusion">Through Christ Our Lord, Amen</p>
